Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a machine learning project for recommending movies based on user preferences. The project demonstrates various recommendation algorithms and provides a complete workflow from data processing to recommendation generation.

Features
Data Collection: Utilizes movie datasets such as MovieLens for user ratings and movie information.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data, including handling missing values and feature extraction.
Recommendation Algorithms: Implements various recommendation techniques including:
Collaborative Filtering: User-based and item-based approaches.
Matrix Factorization: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS).
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on movie features and user preferences.
Evaluation: Assesses recommendation quality using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
User Interface: Provides a simple interface for users to get movie recommendations.
